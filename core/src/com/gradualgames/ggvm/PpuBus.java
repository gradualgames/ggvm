 * This is the Ppu bus. In conjunction with a mapper (ReadWriteRangeProvider),
 * can support chr-ram and chr-rom. Typically the mapper will always provide
 * palette ram and nametable ram. Depending on the mapper, chr data will be
 * mapped to rom or ram. See Mapper classes for more information.
